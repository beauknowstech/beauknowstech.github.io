Everyone gets different boxes. This is just my experience. Everyone also comes from different starting points. So how I studied and what it took for me to pass will be different from what it will take for other people to pass. This is why it is important to talk about… my background. So you can see where I’m coming from.BackgroundI barely graduated high school. 2.5-ish GPA. No college. I genuinely don’t consider myself a smart person (just obsessed about pentest/red team topics). If I can pass this exam then so can you. I do have a lot of experience in IT. About 10 years actually. And currently I am a Web app pentester. I got lucky and my company took a chance on me without any previous security experience and no relevant certs.I get asked a lot if you need dev or IT experience? I’d say yes or at a bare minimum it will make your life a lot easier. If you don’t, I would recommend doing some of the beginner paths on TryHackMe. I believe that Offensive Security is also trying to address this with the level 100 courses that they now offer.So why get OSCP if I already have a jobADD + midlife crisis. I was at this public event. Crying. That I can’t seem to accomplish any of my goals. I have too many things I want to do. Too many things that are interesting. Too many things I want to learn. And I just can’t focus. On anything. I have 10 raspberry pis. All with projects assigned to them. Unfinished. I have over 450 Udemy courses:I’m also on pluralsight, linkedin learning, INE pentesterlab pro. I have active subscriptions to all of those. You can just imagine what my playlists look like.The OSCP gave me something. Something hard. To work towards. I decided with my wife that this is what I wanted to do. I’m going to spend the next bit of my life working towards this goal.I signed up for HTB that day. Then later on in November I saw that the Learn One went on sale for 2k I signed up.Overall Journey once I made the decision to startStarted streaming myself practicing on Hackthebox about 9-10 months ago. Sometime in September 2021Actually sign up for PWKNov 4, 2021Changed exam to include AD announced.December 1st? 2021First exam attempt (No AD)Mid December 2021I didn’t study much until 1.5 months before second exam started. I spent my time doing extra practice on Windows and AD because of the new exam format. If I hadn’t studied the AD portion of the PWK PDF, I probably wouldn’t have passed.I started my exam on 5/31/2022I got the email that I passed my exam on 6/3/2022StatsThe closest measurable metric that we have to determine if someone is ready for the exam. I wish there was a better way to tell if someone is ready but I can’t think of anything better so here we are.35 HTB boxes from TJNulls list45 Proving Grounds boxes. All easy boxes and a lot of medium boxes a few hard.~10 boxes in the PWK labSigned up for pwk on Nov 4 2021, Failed first exam mid December with 65 points.Passed new exam format on June 3rd 2022Timeline of actual examMy study processWhat I did will not work for everyone. I was already a web pentester. I had already been a windows sysadmin and a network engineer. I wasn’t great at those things but it still helped a lot. I’m glad I streamed on twitch. I learned so much from the people in my chat. Not everyone can do this. But I had fun, made some friends and learned a lot. It also kept me accountable.The second thing I did well was I learned by doing. I made notes along the way. Any time I got stuck on either a foothold or a privesc for more than 1.5 hours (I would set a timer). I would look at a writeup or a hint just for that part, not the whole box. Why didn’t I see this before? What check/or methodology step can I add to my notes to make sure I don’t get stuck next time. I feel like doing it this way did two things. It prepared my mind for the approximate timing I was looking for on the exam. It became a race. An hour and a half. I didn’t spend too much time banging my head against the wall and not learning anything. It was a balance of challenging and productive learning.Some people semi-disagree:https://robertscocca.medium.com/avoiding-common-oscp-pitfalls-d2dd929fdb03#:~:text=commands%20for%20hours.-,Hints%20and%20Write%2Dups,-The%20largest%20mistakeI actually mostly agree with the blog post. OVER-reliance is bad. But don’t feel bad if you have to look. This is how you learn.I looked at walkthroughs even if I pwned the machine myself. Several times I found the unintended privesc. And many times I did do the right foothold or privesc but in a different way. It helps to know how to do the same things in a few different ways or with different tools. For example, ASREP roast-ing and kerberoast-ing can both be done from kali using impacket tools. Or they can be done from windows using Rubeus/powershell scripts.I also did practice exams. So on some of the weekends leading up to the exam I did 5- boxes a day like on here:https://github.com/ajdumanhug/oscp-practice(This needs to be updated but its hard to find AD practice machines)For me the key to my style of studying is to actually do. Meaning you can read the PDF, read every blog/reddit post. Watch every youtube video. But it’s not going to stick in your head until you get hands on the keyboard and actually hack stuff. I call it getting your feet wet and your hands dirty.Why did I fail my first examI didn’t do my lab report. 65 points. So close.. It was honestly worse than if I failed by a lot. Or at least that is how it felt at the time.I relied too heavily on enum/recon tools and didn’t do enough manual recon.The only additional study that I did between exam attempts was Active Directory and some more windows machines. I actually took a long break for about 3 months right after I failed my first exam.Advice for if you are brand new.If you really don’t know where to start, do tryhackme first starting with the pre-security path. This will introduce you to how computers and networking works. As well as the windows and linux basics. Then HTB (5 easy windows machines and 5 easy linux machines). Follow along with ippsec for those first 10 or so boxes so you can get the basic methodology down. Next do a bunch of boxes from TJNull’s famous list. Take the boxes from this list and add them to the ToDo list in HackTheBox. Then you can sort them by difficulty. Just start with the easiest ones and work your way down.Then sign up for PWK and do the lab for a few months. Saving proving grounds for the last 2-3 months before the exam as they seem to be the closest to the exam machines.Everyone wants to be as efficient as possible. But I do think that there is a good reason to get the Learn One. One year. Two exam attempts. I think it’s great. If you can… get your work to pay for it. If you are in a dev, IT or security role, they should. That is nothing for most education budgets at most companies.Exercises/Lab report. I still don’t know if I would do it or not if I was starting over. On one hand, I WOULD HAVE PASSED THE FIRST TIME IF I HAD DONE THE LAB REPORT. But how long would it have taken me? People are saying that their lab report is over 300 pages with the training exercises. I just don’t know if it would have been worth it for me.I am very excited to see what the Offsec live stuff will look like, so if you are new I would check that out:https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/offsec-live/I did very few boxes in the PWK lab. Mostly just the two AD sets. I didn’t spend a lot of time in the lab. It was too much fun. Meaning I spend time doing things that weren’t going to help me on the exam. I couldn’t target specific things I was trying to learn. Other than AD, that part was great.Random TIPSThis section may be updated periodically as I think of thingsExpect to learn, not to be taught.I almost failed out of highschool. I graduated with a 2.5 gpa or something like that. I really really suck at being taught. I am ok at learning when it comes to things that are interesting. Luckily hacking is fun. I do it for work and I do it in my free time. I probably should be better at it than I am.The PDF/videos and other training material is good. But its not like a math textbook or something. You have to apply what you are learning and adapt to each situation. They are teaching you the hacker mindset.Backup your kali VM a lotKnow when you work best and when you will want or need a break.On both my exams I started in the morning, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to sleep unless I had enough points to pass. I wish I had the coolness/level headed-ness to start in the afternoon without freaking out all morning before the exam started, and be able to rest at a reasonable hour if I didn’t have enough points.Review the PDF/OSCP training to make sure you cover any knowledge gapsI would have failed my second exam if I didn’t go through the AD portion of the PDF. I didn’t read much of the rest of the PDF other than checking the index to make sure I covered everything in my own studies. I don’t learn well from that kind of format. I learn best from working on machines, making mistakes, looking at hints and walkthroughs, then taking extensive notes. I built a methodology for myself for each step.Which is exactly how I studied. TJnull’s list on HTB first. To get my methodology down. I streamed this for a few months on twitch and got help from all you and bunch of other people who were far more advanced than myself. I do like hackthebox but like everyone says, Proving Grounds boxes are closer to the OSCP. I saved those for last for this purpose.In each case even if I successfully got root/admin I would look at as many walkthroughs as I could to see how other people did it. If they did something differently and it was something I felt was valuable, I would add it to my notes/methodologyWatch these people on twitch/youtubehttps://infosecstreams.github.io/My NotesRight now all my notes are on onenote, which is great for auto backup. But I wish I had found a markdown setup that I like. I tried them all…. joplin/obsidian/notion all the things. I might share my notes if I ever get the time to spend 12 hours converting them all to markdown. But to be honest I don’t think it would help anyone because building your own methodology and your own notes is invaluable. That is how you learn and grow.Read the instructions carefullyReset the box when something that should work isn’t working.Know your tools:Know when and how to use all the tools.Read the blog posthttps://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/understanding-pentest-tools-scripts/https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/issues/125Understand what each of your tools do. They make some good points in the blog post.Don’t rely too hard on helper tools:I love these tools but I think one reason I failed my first exam was my reliance on these tools. And I know for sure that I only passed my second attempt because of my balanced use of these tools in addition to my manual enumeration/recon.https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoReconhttps://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomatorhttps://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumerationhttps://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-nghttps://github.com/itm4n/PrivescCheckhttps://github.com/GhostPack/SeatbeltSome people heavily advise against any auto tools on reddit because they give you TOO much information.https://old.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/n1w87b/passed_oscp_this_week_a_big_thank_you_and_some/#:~:text=While%20I%20understand%20the%20reasoning%20behind%20tools%20like%20AutoRecon%20and%20NmapAutomator%20I%20would%20advice%20against%20using%20them%20on%20your%20exam.%20Just%20go%20through%20the%20machines%20manually%20and%20inspect%20the%20results%20at%20each%20stage.Usually what I do is I have a set of manual tests that I do first and if those checks don’t find anything obvious then I run the auto tools. My manual checklist grows almost every time I have to use auto tools. I add to it whenever I can.OSCP is just the beginning, not an endYou might get job offers, a promotion or something but this cert is entry level. A starting point. Any cyber position, red or blue, is always evolving. You gotta learn every day.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpm_V_88wdsI personally don’t think that pentesting is for everyone. But if you are passionate about it, go for it. If I can get a job and pass OSCP, then so can you.Am I a hacker now?Well yes and no. Yes because just the fact that you wanted the OSCP and we’re curious enough to even figure that out, you are a hacker. You are a hacker for wanting to be a hacker. Go read atomic habits. And no because The OSCP is just the beginning… Plus a hacker is never done learning. And honestly that’s the best partThe OSCP is practical. And you will learn basic technical pentest skills. But I think more of what you learn is the hacker mindset + hacker methodology. I really think that is what they are teaching in the pen-200 course and exam and the cool technical skills you will use for a real pentest job, will come in their higher 300 level and up courses.

Just a standard XSS.I’m about to go full recipe blog:The story of this CVE begins in 2014 when I first heard of the wifi pineapple from Hak5. At the time, I was working in IT making 30k a year and paying for my ex-wife to go to college. I did not have $100 bucks or whatever it was to drop on a wifi-pineapple. In 2016 I saw blog articles like these:http://sapinski.com/2016/02/13/wifi-pineapple-firmware-for-gl-inet-gl-ar150/https://www.securityaddicted.com/2016/11/17/weaponizing-gl-inet-gl-ar150/https://jerrygamblin.com/2016/04/11/turning-a-25-gl-ar150-into-a-100-wifipineapple/?platform=hootsuiteAll claiming you could buy a $25 mini router and turn it into a wifi pineapple. I instantly bought one.But because of my 2x diagnosed ADHD/ADD I never even got as far as installing the wifi pineapple firmware. It had taken about a week to get to my house and by that time I had become obsessed with something else.Fast forward to 2019.I started working as a pentester in July-ish of 2019. Specifically working on web application pentests. At this time whenever I see something on Twitter or LinkedIn about something web-app pentest or bug bounty related, I read it. I came across this blog post:https://infosecwriteups.com/5-000-usd-xss-issue-at-avast-desktop-antivirus-for-windows-yes-desktop-1e99375f0968Reading this made me realize that literally any input could be an XSS and I thought to myself I may as well make an XSS SSID just in case for the future. I have Ubiquiti equipment at home so it was easy enough to create an SSID called &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(2)&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;. Keep in mind that SSID’s have to be less than 32 characters.Fast forward again to late 2021.The pandemic has been “almost over” for a year now.People are starting to go back into the office. I can’t really talk about what I was working on but for a pentest I needed a little router. I remembered back when I bought my GL-AR150 in 2016. I had since moved 5 times. In my last move I decided to index everything that was in each box so I found it relatively fast.I plugged it in and connected to the default network it provided. After setting a root password, I logged in and started navigating around the menus to see if anything would be helpful for my pentest or if I should just install default openwrt.Seemingly out of nowhere I get this popup. For about 4 seconds I was like “WUT….” and then it all clicked. I was on the repeater page where it searches for wifi networks. My SSID that I had made in 2019 finally did something.At this point I just started laughing. I couldn’t believe it. My wife thought something was wrong because of the noises that were coming out of my home office.I didn’t have time to create a real XSS payload like I normally do but I still felt good about finding this one. I decided to take it just one step further using xsshunter.com.As you remember an SSID can only be 32 characters. So my normal xsshunter payloads weren’t going to work. So instead I followed this blog post and created a short domain that forwarded to my normal xsshunter payload page:https://medium.com/@mohameddaher/how-i-paid-2-for-1054-xss-bug-20-chars-blind-xss-payloads-12d32760897bSo now I have an SSID that has my xsshunter payload in it just in case this happens again. So now I’ll get notifications:Something else to remember is that this was purchased in 2016. It had an extremely old firmware on it. So when I found this bug it was running on firmware version 2.19 and the bug was fixed in version 3 of the firmware. The current version as of writing is 3.203.
