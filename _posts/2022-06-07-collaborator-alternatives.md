# Free Burp Collaborator Alternatives

The best one that you don't have to host yourself is [interact.sh](https://app.interactsh.com/#/) by far. But I've seen that domain get blocked before on outbound traffic from targets. So you may want to use one of the others as a backup or setup your own server using the instructions on the [interact.sh github](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh).
